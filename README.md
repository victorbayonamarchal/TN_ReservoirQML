This work tries to simulate quantum systems for analog quantum machine learning using tensor networks techniques. To start using, install requirements. 

The files datatools.py, qtools.py include helper functions. The file spinchain.py includes the class definition for the spin chain Hamiltonian model. 
The file parallel_QELM_classifier.py can be used to process images in a parallelazied way. 

The notebooks include the statistical results presented in the work.
